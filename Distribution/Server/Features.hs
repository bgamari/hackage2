-- | This module ties together all the hackage features that we will use.

-- To add a feature:
--
-- * Import its initialization function
-- * Call its initialization function with all of its required arguments
-- * Add it to the allFeatures list

-- TODO:
-- * PackageServe: serving from tarballs (most of the work is setting it up on import)
-- * Snippet: code samples, pastebin for 'getting started' code
-- * LibraryRank: http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/ticket/183
-- * HaskellPlatform: mark off packages in the haskell platform.
-- * Anonymous build reports should work, as well as candidate build reports
-- * alter Users to be more in line with the current way registering is handled,
--     with email addresses available to maintainers, etc.
-- * UserNotify: email users and let them email each other
-- * Backup: would need a [HackageFeature] to backup, though a HackageFeature itself.
--     best approach is probably to write backup tarball to disk and transfer
--     it away through non-HTTP means (somewhat more secure)
