-- A type belonging to the HackageFeature class is a data structure from which
-- a HackageModule can be created. These data structures are initialized manually
-- in Features.hs, possibly depending on each other to register for hooks, construct
-- URIs, and (maybe in the future) retrieve or encapsulate TxControl handles.
--
-- With this class, they are combined into homogenous list of HackageModules
-- used by the Server data structure.
