This is a copy of [the hackage2 codebase found here](http://code.haskell.org/hackage-server/),
converted to make it more convenient for github users to hack on it. The 
repository conversion was done with 
[darcs-fastconvert](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/darcs-fastconvert). I'll 
appreciate if someone better versed in darcs than I is willing to help push 
any changes made back upstream to avoid getting things out of sync.

A few minor changes have been made to get it to compile on my system. Can't 
promise it will build on yours, though. :]
