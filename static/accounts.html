<h2>User accounts</h2>
<p>Most of the functions of the HackageDB web interface
(including browsing and checking packages) are available to all.
However, uploading packages requires a HackageDB username and password.

<p> The policy for getting an account is still up in the air. Meanwhile, you
can peruse the <a href="/users/">small list of users</a> (no accounts have
been imported from the main Hackage). You can also
<a href="/users/register">register a new user account</a>.

<p>Passwords are stored encrypted, so if you forget yours we can't recover it,
but will need to assign a new one. Just ask.
